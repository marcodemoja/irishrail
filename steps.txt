*ask departure and destination stations
* get all the TrainCode of the current trains getCurrentTrainsXML_WithTrainType?TrainType=A .
* get all stops for every TrainCode getTrainMovementsXML?TrainId=p750&TrainDate=23%20nov%202017
* pick the train/trains that have the departure station in their stops list with correct direction ( northbound/southbound ) and where departureTime > currentTime.
	**if any of the trains contains departure and destination station as well, then you have found a direct train.
	**if none of the trains contains the couple of departure/destination then you need to find a coincidence
	 	**in order to find a coincidence you need to find all the running trains that contain destination station
			and share at least one stop with the trains selected as possible first train to take. you have to consider the right direction as well.
